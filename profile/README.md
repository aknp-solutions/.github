**fids-airport-manager** is now located at https://github.com/amsdc/fids-airport-manager
> **Note regarding this project:**
> 
> Due to the time constraints and restrictions on technical complexity of the CBSE Class 12 Computer Science project, the team was unable to build a production-ready version. The current version is only for demonstration purposes.
>
> The original architecture was designed to be based on the Server-Client networking model, using real time communication protocols such as WebSocket. The server would be a REST API with Microservices. Redundancy and algorithmic efficiency were important design factors.
>
> If any airport operations authority is interested in the development of the production version project, please drop a mail at amsdc.webmaster@gmail.com. Mention the Airport Name, code and expected number of displays in the mail.



**WEMFStack** is now located at https://github.com/amsdc/WEMFStack
> **Note regarding this project:**
>
> The maintainers of this repository have decided not to develop this tool. This is because many other similar tools already exist, and the Flask development mode is sufficient for testing purposes.
